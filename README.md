# [echo-fauxmo](https://thehappydinoa.github.io/echo-fauxmo/)

For controlling local devices with the Amazon Echo. And for controlling iTach devices to send ir signals to devices. This replaces the Harmony Hub

Originally Based on [echo](https://github.com/toddmedema/echo)

## Quick Start

1.  `git clone https://github.com/thehappydinoa/echo-fauxmo`
2.  `cd https://github.com/thehappydinoa/echo-fauxmo`
3.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  `python example-minimal.py`
5.  Tell Echo, "discover my devices"
6.  Use Echo's "turn off device" and "device on" to see True/False script output

## Working with iTach

1.  Find the IR codes that you want to send with [iLearn from Global Cache](https://www.globalcache.com/files/software/iLearn.exe)
2.  Edit 'itach-device-handler.py' with the IPs and IR codes you want to use
3.  `python itach_device_handler.py`

## Working with XBox

1.  To find the IP of your Xbox, go to Settings -> Network -> Advanced settings. To find your Live device ID, go to Settings -> System -> Console info. NOTE: It's probably a good idea to keep this information a secret!
2.  Edit 'wol_device_handler.py' to include your XBox Live ID and IP

## Optional

-   I would suggest using `Screen` to make it headless

Install `Screen` by running

    sudo apt-get install screen

## TODO

-   Make Web Server for if-then statements (like a more customizable version of IFTTT)
-   Make Raspberry Pi OS with Web Server for instant deployment
